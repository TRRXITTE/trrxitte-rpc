- More data in homepage "Network Summary":

        * UTXO set size
        * Total coins in circulation
        * Market cap

- Tweaks to data in blocks lists:
    * Simpler timestamp formatting for easy reading
    * Include "Time-to-Mine" (TTM) for each block (with green/red highlighting for "fast"/"slow" (<5min/>15min) blocks)

If your app is crashing, consider setting a higher memory ceiling: `node --max_old_space_size=XXX bin/www` (where `XXX` is measured in MB).
- Lots of minor bug fixes
